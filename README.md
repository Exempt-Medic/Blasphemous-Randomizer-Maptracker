This is my first map tracker, and there's gonna be so many mistakes, which ViviMayoi has helped me a BUNCH with, but let me know if you find more! Sassyvania@gmail.com // Saskrotch#3206

First of all, I want to give a huge thank you to Demajen, whose tireless work on extremely complete Metroidvania maps, including Blasphemous, made this tracker way less of a headache than it would've been, and for sending me a higher quailty, complete, blank map to work with.

And a hefty thank you to Damocles03, not just for making the randomizer, but for supplying me with a spreadsheet of the logic. 

And also a big smoochy thank you to br00ty and j_im for helping me with my newbie baby codey questions!

## Installation

Unzip into PopTracker's "packs" folder. That's it! On macOS, you'll find the packs folder by right clicking on poptracker.app, clicking Show Package Contents, and navigating to `Contents > MacOS > Packs`.

## Notes
1) Jibrael quest is included in the current files, but isn't in a release yet.
1) Quests! There's a few checks on the map that don't actually give you an in game item, but add a hidden item to the tracker inventory to unlock the next step of a quest. Right now this includes Cleofas, Esdras and his Sister, the Miriam crossover event, and Redento (although the last two are in the item tracker).
