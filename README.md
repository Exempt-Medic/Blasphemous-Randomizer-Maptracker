This is my first map tracker, and there's gonna be so many mistakes, which ViviMayoi has helped me a BUNCH with, but let me know if you find more! Sassyvania@gmail.com // Saskrotch#3206

First of all, I want to give a huge thank you to Demajen, whose tireless work on extremely complete Metroidvania maps, including Blasphemous, made this tracker way less of a headache than it would've been, and for sending me a higher quailty, complete, blank map to work with.

And a hefty thank you to Damocles03, not just for making the randomizer, but for supplying me with a spreadsheet of the logic. 

And also a big smoochy thank you to br00ty and j_im for helping me with my newbie baby codey questions!

## Installation

Unzip into PopTracker's "packs" folder. That's it! On macOS, you'll find the packs folder by right clicking on poptracker.app, clicking Show Package Contents, and navigating to `Contents > MacOS > Packs`.

## Notes
1) Jibrael quest is included in the current files, but isn't in a release yet.
2) Quests! There's a few checks on the map that don't actually give you an in game item, but add a hidden item to the tracker inventory to unlock the next step of a quest. Right now this includes Cleofas, Esdras and his Sister, the Miriam crossover event, and Redento (although the last two are in the item tracker).

3a) Archipelago Auto Tracking: A lot of check names have been changed to reflect the AP location descriptions, and because it requires two name fields to properly auto-check. Once location mapping is finished, we'll make another pass to make them all match up. Main goal is usability for now.

3b) Some locations and checks simply can't be auto-tracked, due to their nature or simply not being checks in the game. So keep in mind:
    Confessor Dungeons and Amanecidas rewards are progressive. First one you beat gives you first rewards, second gives you second, etc. There's no way to auto track these so you'll have to do them yourself.
    
    You'll have to manually check off the Jondo statue and bell checks to open the grievance ascends checks.
    Same goes with Jibrael's quest start and four checks across the map to open Amanecida fights.
    
    You'll have to check off Redento quests manually, as they either give no item or host a redento check to keep you on your way
    
    Miriam gate completeion isn't checked in AP, just completion of the quest.
    No way to automatically check Chalice of Inverted Verses fill status.

## To-Do

Add more prayers 

Update Cherub prayer logic

Change all location names to match checks in Archipelago for ease of use
